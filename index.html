      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a <strong>future full-stack web developer</strong>, presently re-discovering my love coding so I can eventually start Me Inc.  After mastering html and css, I plan to conquer Angular, as well as a backend language framework (probably Ruby/Rails, but I haven't ruled python out completely).</p>
      <p>The most important thing to me is <strong>health and wellness</strong> - physical, mental, and spiritual.  I believe that these are all vital parts of each human, and you have to take care of each of them to keep yourself running optimally.</p>
      <p>I really value freedom of thought, creativity, and perserverance.  <strong>Also, pugs</strong>.  Can't get enough of those little guys.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>The whole province of Ontario is my home - I've been all over the place.  Although Ottawa is presently called home, my heart is in Peterborough for some weird reason.  I love that place.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>My number one hobby is bodybuilding.  So basically lifting heavy things and preparing food.  That said, I really love  surfing and wish I could do it often enough to call it a hobby.</p>
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>The ultimate dream is create a successful tech or fitness or tech/fitness startup.  In the interim, I would really like to get involved in the early days of a startup, working with like-minded people, ideally in a dog-friendly office.</p>
      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
      <p>My playlist these days consists of: Arms and Sleepers, Tycho, Knife Party, Latitudes, Jack U, and perhaps a bit of Taylor Swift.</p>
